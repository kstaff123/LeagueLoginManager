# League Login Manager

League Login Manager is an Electron-based application that allows you to store your excessive amount of smurf accounts and login to them quickly. Gone are the days of digging up credentials for your smurfs.

## Features

- Store multiple League of Legends accounts with their ranks, usernames, and passwords
- Easily log in to the game with the stored credentials
- Add as many accounts as you'd like
- Built with Electron, Tailwind CSS, RobotJS, and Swiper

## Installation

1. Download latest release setup executable
2. Run!

## Future

- I plan on eventually switching from RobotJS to a C++ script to allow a more robust login process.
- Ability to edit accounts
- Show/hide credentials
